Instructions for participants

Dear participant:

To achieve the desired effective and efficient knowledge, please read these ideas to explain how to
make the best use of this training program:

1.     This program contains interconnected and structured information that is consistent with one
another. Therefore, attending without absenteeism will help visualize the program's overall
objective, capture the gist of its contents and how interdependent they are.

2.     Do not hesitate to inquire about what you missed or what you did not understand in the
topics, asking the trainer and fellow colleagues will enrich your knowledge and confirm your
understanding of the topics.

3.    Take notes of the comments, ideas and/or discussions you come across to refer to them later
on for on-the-job tasks or to drive the notions home.

4.     You and your group have varied and rich experiences. Your participation in the dialogues and
workshops will improve both your and their skills. Proposing and sharing your knowledge with your
colleagues would either enrich their information or have yours rectified, which is positively
impactful.

5.     Pay attention to what your Trainer explains, also any oral interventions of your fellow
trainees, and make a record of what you think is essential and necessary.

6.     After the end of each session, summarize the most prominent points that you've come across
in the best way you see fit, a mind map, a schedule, list by points, or recorded notes so you could
refer back to it conveniently.

7.    Practice the new skill as soon as you learn it. Only knowing it is not sufficient to acquire
it. Rather, practice makes perfect.

8.     Make sure to pass on what you have learned to the others; that way, it will get memorized.

9.     Make sure to evaluate the training program as per the ad-hoc form; It will be used later in
improving this program with its components (The content, training setting, trainer, trainees, tools
and means).



Introduction Abu Abdullah and Abu Khaled sat together after Maghrib. Abu Khaled: Oh brother. Until
when would the imam deal with worshippers like that? May Allah guide him! Abu Abdullah: By Allah, I
fed up with him. Did you hear his warning after prayer this time: "Don't shut the door strongly
during prayer?!" The door lock is broken, brother! And it requires fixing. Doesn't he know this? He
must change his attitude. Abu Khaled: How do we change it? I think we should complain about him to
the ministry. Did you hear what he said to Abu Saad yesterday at Ishaa prayer about silencing the
phone? Abu Abdullah: I think Abu Saad's hearing is weak, may Allah heal him. He should have spoken
to him alone in private; it is not appropriate to advise him like that. And what if we complain
about him, what is the benefit of doing so? Abu Khaled: So let's talk to him after Ishaa and try to
advise him to change his attitude. May Allah rectify him. Abu Abdullah: Let's go, with the blessing
of Allah.

With this dialogue, Abu Khalid and Abu Abdullah closed the discussion about the problem of dealing
with the imam of the mosque. And it is clear that the relationship of the worshippers with the imam
is of great importance. The intelligent imam should win the affection and love of the mosque
community as this relationship is of great importance because it is related to a great worship. And
this relationship must be reflected positively on the mosque community in order for this to take
effect in the mosque. But who is the mosque community?

What is the importance of dealing well with them? How can the relationship between the imam and the
mosque group be portrayed? The subject of "The Arts of Dealing with the Mosque Community and
Influencing them", was divided into two parts; whereas the first part deals with communicating and
dealing with the mosque community. And this part is also divided into nine chapters, as follows:
â¢    Who is the mosque community? â¢    The importance of dealing well with the mosque community and
its significance â¢    The principles of dealing with the mosque community â¢    The personality of
the imam and its dimensions â¢    Developing impressions and feelings about others â¢    Values,
perception, attitudes and their impact on behavior and dealing with others â¢    Motives that drive
the Muslim to be good in dealing with people â¢    Your personality patterns and their impact on the
way you are dealing with people â¢    Skills and techniques of effective dealing with different
types of people â The second part reviews the skills of dealing with the mosque community, where it
is divided into four chapters as follows:



How to deal with the mistakes of the mosque community Islamic ways of dealing with people Effective
communication skills with the mosque community Techniques of influencing the mosque community



And we ask Allah to put goodness and benefit in it. And all praise is due to Allah, Lord of the
worlds.

The Importance of Dealing Well with the Mosque Community and Its Significance

The importance of dealing well with the mosque community is based on Islamic teachings about the
significance of the mosque and the congregation prayer. It was narrated by Abu Huraira (RA) that
the Prophet (PBUH) said, "As long as any-one of you is waiting for the prayer, he is considered to
be praying actually, and the angels say, 'O Allah! Be merciful to him and forgive him', (and go on
saying so) unless he leaves his place of praying or breaks his ablution."(1) And it was narrated by
Ibn Omar (RA) that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: "The prayer in congregation is twenty-seven
times superior to the prayer offered by person alone."(2) And the main principle of the mosques is
to build them to remember Allah, may He be exalted, and to establish prayers. And the Muslim must
be kind and gentle with his Muslim brother generally. Let alone if they meet in one of Allah's
houses. It is the place of continuous meetings between Muslims and these meetings happen five times
every day. And if one of them is missing others would ask about him and check on his conditions.
Allah, may He be exalted said: "The believers are but brothers, so make settlement between your
brothers. And fear Allah that you may receive mercy." (3) One of the most important things that the
mosque community should have is that prayer should have a positive impact on their behaviour and
morals, especially while they are in the mosque.

Good manners are of great importance. And whoever contemplates on the texts of the Quran and Sunnah
concerning good dealings and manners, can clearly observe the prestigious place that good manners
have in the Islamic Sharia and rituals. To the extent that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) would
describe his mission, and the purpose of his Da'wah by saying in the hadith narrated by Abu Huraira
(RA): "I have only been sent to perfect good characteristics."(4) Hence, it shows that a good
manner and character is of high status in Islam.

The great status of good dealing and beautiful character can be explained by the following points:
1-    It is one of the most important purposes of prophet Muhammad's mission (PBUH) to the people,
as Allah, may He be exalted said: "It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from
themselves reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom -
although they were before in clear error".(5) So, Allah has sent a messenger to teach the people
the Qur'an. And to purify them. And purifying means, in the sense of cleansing and purifying the
hearts from Shirk (polytheism) and immorality, such as hatred, envy. And purifying the words and
actions of bad morals and customs. And it is confirmed by the hadith we mentioned above "I have
only been sent to perfect good characteristics."(6)

2-    Morality is a close part of faith and belief: it was narrated that Abdullah ibn Amr (RA)
said: "The Prophet (PBUH) said: "The best among you are the best in character (having good
manners)."And the Prophet never used bad language neither a Fahish (innately immoral) nor a
Mutafahish (act immoral)."(7) And it was also narrated that he (PBUH) said: "Shall I not tell you
of the dearest of you to me, and the ones who will be seated closest to me on the Day of
Resurrection?" The people remained silent, and he repeated it two or three times, then the people
said: Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He said: "The best of you in attitude."(8)

3-    Allah, may He be exalted, described iman by calling it righteousness. He said in the Quran
"Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true]
righteousness is [in] one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the
prophets and gives wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler,
those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives Zakah;
[those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverty and
hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the
righteous."(1) And the word "Al-Birr" (in Arabic) which is translated as righteousness, represents
all sets of goodness from manners, sayings and actions. It was narrated that Nawwas ibn Sam' an
(RA) said: I stayed with Allah's Messenger (PBUH) for one year. What obstructed me to migrate was
(nothing) but (persistent) inquiries from him (about Islam). (It was a common observation) that
when anyone of us migrated (to Medina) he ceased to ask (too many questions) from Allah's Messenger
(PBUH). So I asked him about virtue and vice. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (PBUH) said: "Virtue is a
kind disposition and vice is what rankles in your mind and that you disapprove of its being known
to the people." (2)

4-    Morality is linked to most of the worships in Islam. And Allah, may He be exalted, shows in
many of the worships that one of its purposes is to reform and develop morality for the individual
and society. And you can see it clearly in the Quran when He says "Recite, [O Muhammad], what has
been revealed to you of the Book and establish prayer. Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and
wrongdoing, and the remembrance of Allah is greater. And Allah knows that which you do."(3) And it
was narrated by Abu Huraira (RA) that he said, the messenger of Allah (PBUH) said "If one does not
eschew lies and false conduct, Allah has no need that he should abstain from his food and his
drink."(4) Thus, whoever his fasting does not have an effect on himself and his character, he did
not achieve the goal of fasting and its purpose.

5-    The great virtues and reward that Allah has prepared for good manners. And the evidences of
that are many from the Quran and Sunnah. Among them what was narrated by Abu Ad-Dardaa (RA) that
the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: "Nothing is placed on the Scale that is heavier than good
character. Indeed, the person with good character will have attained the rank of the person of
fasting and prayer." (5) And it was also narrated that he (PBUH) said: "Shall I not tell you of the
dearest of you to me and the ones who will be seated closest to me on the Day of Resurrection?" The
people remained silent, and he repeated it two or three times, then the people said: Yes, O
Messenger of Allah. He said: "The best of you in attitude."(6) Which means that his status at the
top of paradise is guaranteed and confirmed by the Prophet (PBUH).(7)

6-    The role model of this Ummah (PBUH) was the ideal and the supreme example of a great
character. As you can read Allah's praise of this aspect in the Quran when He said "And indeed, you
are of a great moral character."(8) He (PBUH) was the best man in moral character. And the mother
of believers Aisha (RA) described his character in a comprehensive manner. As it was narrated by
Yazid ibn Yabnus said, "We went to 'A'isha and said, 'Umm al-Mu'minin, what was the character of
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, like?' She replied, 'His character
was the Qur'an. Can you recite the Surah entitled "The Believers"?' She said, 'Recite: "Certainly
will the believers have succeeded: They who are during their prayer humbly submissive. And they who
turn away from ill speech. And they who are observant of Zakah. And they who guard their private
parts." (Quran, 23:1-5)' She said, 'That was the character of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace.'"(9)

7-    Then ponder on this high and great honorable deal of prophetic prayers and Dua for asking
Allah to give us good character and morals. Here is the prophet of Allah (PBUH) calls on his Lord
to improve his character, which is already great, and to guide him to the best of manners. As it
was narrated by Jabir bin Abdullah that he said, "When the Prophet (PBUH) started to pray, he would
say the Takbir, then say: ' Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and my dying are
for Allah, Lord of the worlds. No partner has He. And this I have been commanded, and I am the
first of the Muslims. O Allah, guide me to the best of deeds and the best of manners, for none can
guide to the best of them but You. And protect me from bad deeds and bad manners, for none can
protect against them but You."(10) And these examples are many in the authentic Sunnah.

Principles of dealing with the mosque community

Muslims deal with each other according to several principles:

â¢    Human nature â¢    Common human traits that affect the dealing with others â¢    What do people
like? And what do they hate?

And from those principles, Muslim's dealing with each other is based upon. And the following is a
breakdown to those principles:

First: Understanding human nature: And it is clear through two important things: First: Realizing
the huge differences between the nature of people. And that would be followed by differences and
variations of methods of dealing and communication since people were different from the time they
were created by Allah. They are different in natures, desires and inclinations. As it was narrated
by Abu Musa al-Ash'ari (RA) that he said: "The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: "Allah created Adam
from a handful which he took from the whole of the earth; so the children of Adam are in accordance
with the earth: some red, some white, some black, some a mixture, also smooth and rough, bad and
good."(1) And in a similar meaning, Ibn Abi Al-Kharjein said:(2)

People are like the earth, and from the earth they are................. In roughness and in their
softness Some stones we avoid that might hurt our feet ................ other stones we would use
them on our eyes

And it is known intuitively that dealing with these differences the same way is not right. What
suits this person does not suit the other. So it was said, "Speak to people as much as they can
understand." As people come from different cultures, environments, sects, and different
mentalities. So, each of them must be addressed according to his intellect, as was the case of the
Prophet (PBUH) in dealing with his companions and in teaching them. He takes into account the
conditions of those whom he deals with. And treats each one of them in the best way befits them.â

It was narrated by Ibn Abbas (RA): When the Prophet (PBUH) alighted at Marr az-Zahran, al-Abbas
said: I thought, I swear by Allah, if the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) enters Mecca with the army by
force before the Quraysh come to him and seek protection from him, it will be their total ruin. So
I rode on the mule of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and thought, Perhaps I may find a man coming
for his needs who will to the people of Mecca and inform them of the position of the Messenger of
Allah (PBUH), so that they may come to him and seek protection from him. While I was on my way, I
heard Abu Sufyan and Budayl ibn Warqa' speaking. I said: O Abu Hanzalah! He recognized my voice and
said: AbulFadl? I replied: Yes. He said: who is with you, may my parents be a sacrifice for you? I
said: Here is the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and his people (with him). He asked: Which is the way
out? He said: He rode behind me, and his companion returned. When the morning came, I brought him
to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and he embraced Islam. I said: Messenger of Allah, Abu Sufyan is a
man who likes this pride, do something for him. He said: Yes, he who enters the house of Abu Sufyan
is safe; he who closes the door upon him is safe; and he who enters the mosque is safe." He said,
the people scattered to their houses and in the mosque.(3) And this was during the conquest of
Mecca. And we know that Abu Sufyan's house is no different than any other house of the people of
Mecca. But this shows us how the Prophet (PBUH) dealt well with Abu Sufyan in the way that befits
him.

Among these examples also, his distribution (PBUH) of some of the spoils and bounties to certain
people and exclude other people in order to win their hearts, in the Battle of Hunayn for an
example. As well as dividing the works and tasks between his companions according to their
capabilities. So that what was entrusted to Hassaan is other than what was entrusted to Muadh. And
this is true with Abu Bakr, Omar, Soheib, Khaled and the rest of the companions, may Allah be
pleased with them all. There are many pieces of evidence of authentic sources and reports that
clearly indicate the importance of knowing the people's nature and personality, what they can
tolerate or bare and what they love as this has a great role in benefiting the people and
influencing them.

Second: Understanding human nature: The human being is not a machine, but it is a complex creation.
And he is made up of soul, body, mind, and feelings. And he needs this to be taken into account
when addressing him. So, he is wrong who focuses only on one side without the other. Such as taking
into account the ideological and intellectual aspect only, without considering the human feelings
and the psychological state of the addressee. It is not enough that what you say is true in itself,
but it must take into account the good wording and put it in a form that brings it closer to him
and to his heart as well as taking into account the appropriate timing and likewise in several
important matters that need to be taken into account.

Second: Understanding of Common Human Traits That Effects the Dealing with Others:

There are established and common rules based on human nature in which it is equally dealt with by
the Muslim and others. But knowing and applying them has a profound impact on influence. And among
these rules:

1-    These points are all related to dealing with normal and saint people. As for the abnormal
people, they require individual treatment according to what is suitable for them. Some people may
not be suited to be treated gently or with kindness because of their harshness and corruption. As
Abu at-Tayeb al-Mutanabbi said in his poem entitled with "Every man shall get from life what he
used to be": (1) If you honor the kind (man), you would own him....... And if you honor the unkind,
he would rebel

2-    The way of dealing varies depending on the differences of the relationship: the father with
his son, the husband with his wife, the manager with those under him, and vice versa.

3-    The way of dealing changes according to the differences in understanding and differences in
minds. The way we deal with the intelligent and wise man differs from the way we deal with the
other not so bright or wise, and not so knowledgeable. The speech with him should be appropriate to
his nature and ability to understand.

4-    The way of dealing also varies by personality. The way of dealing with a person who is
confused or sensitive is different from the way we do with a normal person. The way is different
with the different personalities and the different qualities they might have. So, do not deal with
people with your way and style without taking care of this important matter. And it is nice to
mention here what the Western writer Dale Carnegie said, "Personally I am very fond of strawberries
and cream, but I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer worms. So when I went
fishing, I didn't think about what I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn't bait the
hook with strawberries and cream. Rather, I dangled a worm or grasshopper in front of the fish and
said: "Wouldn't you like to have that?" Why not use the same common sense when fishing for people?"
(2) â

Third: What People Love and What They Hate

â¢    It was narrated by Anas (RA) that the Prophet (PBUH) said, "None of you will have faith till
he wishes for his (Muslim) brother what he likes for himself."(1) And this is a great issue and a
clear principle in dealing well with others.

See how you would like to be treated by others. And anything you hate to be treated with. And this
would be your guide not to mistreat others. And despite the clarity of this rule theoretically, but
many fail to apply them practically. And as a matter of illustration, we mention here some of the
most important matters that people love, so you can take care of them. And some of what they hate,
so you can avoid:

â¢    It is from the nature of human beings that they would like to be corrected without hurting
their feelings. So, make sure that you do not face anyone with what he hates. So, you say for
example, this is wrong, or this is a flawed opinion and things like that. Rather try to hint or say
indirectly. As it was narrated that Aisha (RA) that Allah's Messenger (PBUH) granted permission for
doing a thing, but some persons amongst the people avoided it. This was conveyed to Allah's Apostle
(PBUH), and he was so much annoyed that the sign of his anger appeared on his face. He then said:
"What has happened to the people that they avoid that for which permission has been granted to me?
By Allah, I have the best knowledge of Allah amongst them, and fear Him most amongst them."(2)

â¢    Aim towards winning their hearts rather than defeating them in arguments. And remember this
prophetic guidance in the hadith narrated by Abu Umamah (RA), that the messenger of Allah said:" I
guarantee a house in the surroundings of Paradise for a man who avoids quarreling even if he were
in the right, a house in the middle of Paradise for a man who avoids lying even if he were joking,
and a house in the upper part of Paradise for a man who made his character good."(3) And try to
make the right and true thing coming from his side by saying for example, "Your words have
benefited me so much". And you can say things, for example, and then add your points in the right
place at the right time in a way that does not make him feel inferior to you in the argument.
Hence, there are so many speaking techniques; it is important for the imam to learn them and
practice them.

â¢    Show to people that you care about them: people love that person who cares about them, what
they are thinking, and what busy their minds. And when they talk, he listens to their conversation,
looks at them, understands what they are saying and discuss it with them.

â¢    Try to fulfill their needs: as Ibn Umar (RA) reported: The Prophet (PBUH) said, "The most
beloved people to Allah are those who are most beneficial to people. The most beloved deed to Allah
is to make a Muslim happy, or to remove one of his troubles, or to forgive his debt, or to feed his
hunger. That I walk with a brother regarding a need is more beloved to me than that I seclude
myself in this mosque in Medina for a month. Whoever swallows his anger, then Allah will conceal
his faults. Whoever suppresses his rage, even though he could fulfill his anger if he wished, then
Allah will secure his heart on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever walks with his brother regarding a
need until he secures it for him, then Allah Almighty will make his footing firm across the bridge
on the day when the footings are shaken."(4)



And among this, is trying to provide services to others before they even ask for them because
people have been brought to love and appreciate those who are good to them.

â¢    A sincere smile is the greatest messenger to the hearts: And the facial expressions are the
best expressers of one's feelings. The friendly face with a natural and honest smile is the best
way to win people and attain their love. And smiling is Sadaqah (charity) and a recommendation of
the best creation (PBUH) given to Abu Dhar (RA), where he said, "Your smiling in the face of your
brother is charity, commanding good and forbidding evil is charity, your giving directions to a man
lost in the land is charity for you. Your seeing for a man with bad sight is a charity for you,
your removal of a rock, a thorn or a bone from the road is charity for you. Your pouring what
remains from your bucket into the bucket of your brother is charity for you."(1) â¢    Give gifts to
one another and you will love one another: as gifts might be simple in cost, but it gives happiness
and shows the level of care someone has to another. As it was narrated from the Hadith of Abu
Huraira (RA) that the Prophet (PBUH) said "Give gifts to one another and you will love one
another."(2)

â¢    Understand the emotions of others. And enrich their noble emotions. Just as you have a passion
that often leads you to take a certain position or adopt a special opinion, others have emotions as
well. Just as it pleases you that others take your emotions into account, they too are pleased that
their emotions are taken into account. If you say to him, for example, I am not blaming you, as I
will do the same if I were you. This will ensure that he is attracted to your point of view. And it
would take away all the hatred or bad perception that could have arises between you if you were in
dispute about something. It's a perfectly successful way to win people to your point of view, while
it wouldn't be harmful if it failed.

â¢    And one of the things that earn a man a good reputation and a good acceptance from the people,
is his readiness to abide and follow to the truth, and admit his mistakes with bravery and courage,
while maintaining complete politeness and showing apology. As this is considered from wisdom which
whoever has been given it, has certainly been given much good. And with it conflicts are resolved,
hearts are relieved and joined, even if they were about to separate and abandon each other. And it
would turn the enemy to be a friend. As it was narrated by Abdullah ibn Masood (RA) that the
Prophet (PBUH) said "The one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin."(3)

â¢    And one of the things that people hate in dealings: advice in public, no one disputes this.
So, you should be careful to be kind and smart in conveying advice to people. Whether it is an
individual or a group, and let your goal is how to get my advice to his heart before it reaches his
hearing. And I leave you with this beautiful story of the kindness in advice while trying to get
into the heart of a person through the best and most beautiful doors of his heart. It was narrated
by Haroon ibn Abdullah al-Jamal that he said: Ahmed ibn Hanbal came to me and knocked on my door at
night. And I said: Who is this? And he said: "I am Ahmed" So, I went out to him, and we greeted
each other, and I asked him, Are you in need of something, O Abu Abdullah? He said: "You occupied
my mind." I said: For what O Abu Abdullah? He said: "I passed nearby you today when you were
teaching the people while you sat under the shade and they were under the sun with their pens and
notebooks. Do not do this again. If you were to set down, then set down with the people."(4) Here
is an important note that the narrator of the story acknowledges the status of Abu Abdullah and how
he came at night. But Imam Ahmed did not make him feel any inferiority; rather, he showed him care
and attention. And dealt with him with humility when he came to his house and did not send anyone
to him and did not talk to him or advise him in public. â

â¢    Avoid too much blaming and reproaching: people hate those who blame and reproach with and
without reason. It is wrong for a man to continue in the blaming after his friend has shown regret
and apology. Surely, blame and reproach have a bitter taste, and it is heavy take as humans. So,
try to avoid it so you can gain the love of others. And look at the way of the Messenger of Allah
(PBUH) and how he dealt with the sinners, and you will see wonders. One example of that is his way
of dealing with Hatib ibn Abi Balta'ah (RA). As it was narrated in Sahih Muslim that Ubaidullah ibn
Rafi', who was the scribe of 'Ali (RA), reported: I heard 'Ali (RA) as saying: Allah's Messenger
(PBUH) sent me and Zubair and Miqdad saying: Go to the garden of, Khakh [it is a place between
Medina and Mecca at a distance of twelve miles from Medina] and there you will find a woman riding
a camel. She would be in possession of a letter, which you must get from her. So we rushed on
horses, and when we met that woman, we asked her to deliver that letter to us. She said: There is
no letter with me. We said: Either bring out that letter, or we would take off your clothes. She
brought out that letter from (the plaited hair of) her head. We delivered that letter to Allah's
Messenger (PBUH) in which Hatib ibn Abu Balta'a had informed some people amongst the polytheists of
Mecca about the affairs of Allah's Messenger (PBUH). Allah's Messenger (PBUH) said: Hatib, what is
this? He said: Allah's messenger, do not be hasty in judging my intention. I was a person attached
to the Quraish. Sufyan said: He was their ally but had no relationship with them. (Hatib further
said): Those who are with you amongst the emigrants have blood-relationship with them (the Quraish)
and thus, they would protect their families. I wished that when I had no blood-relationship with
them I should find some supporters from (amongst them) who would help my family. I have not done
this because of any unbelief or apostasy, and I have no liking for the unbelief after I have
(accepted) Islam. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (PBUH) said: You have told the truth. 'Umar said:
Allah's Messenger, permit me to strike the neck of this hypocrite. But he (the Holy Prophet) said:
He was a participant in Badr and you little know that Allah revealed about the people of Badr: Do
what you like for there is forgiveness for you. "(1)

â¢    Never allow yourself to become egocentric, selfish, narcissistic or arrogant. This trait is
hated by all rational people. And very few escapes from falling into it. You would be better off
taking advantage of the opportunities of successes and achievements that Allah makes on your hands
to humbly praise and thank those who participated in this with you, and you benefited from them
even a little.

â¢    Show the good things and overlook the bad things when you remember others. And balance the bad
things with the good ones as the Prophet (PBUH) instructed men in their dealing with their wives.
As it was narrated by Abu Huraira (RA) said: "The Prophet(PBUH) said: "A believing man should not
hate a believing woman; if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will be pleased with
another."(2) As no one is safe from error. And it was narrated that Said bin Al-Musaib said, "There
is no honorable man, nor a scholar, or a great man unless he has errors. It is just that among the
people are some whom their errors should not be mentioned." So, whoever his goodness surpasses his
shortcomings, it would make his shortcomings disappear. We were taught by the Prophet(PBUH) in the
Hadith of Hisham ibn Zaid in which he heard Anas ibn Malik (RA) saying: Abu Bakr and Al-`Abbas
passed by one of the gatherings of the Ansar who were weeping then. He (i.e. Abu Bakr or Al-`Abbas)
asked, "Why are you weeping?" They replied, "We are weeping because we remember the gathering of
the Prophet (PBUH) with us." So Abu Bakr went to the Prophet (PBUH) and told him of that. The
Prophet (PBUH) came out, tying his head with a piece of the hem of a sheet. He ascended the pulpit,
which he never ascended after that day. He glorified and praised Allah and then said, "I request
you to take care of the Ansar as they are my near companions to whom I confided my private secrets.
They have fulfilled their obligations and rights, which were enjoined on them, but there remains
what is for them. So, accept the good of the good-doers amongst them and excuse the wrongdoers
amongst them."(3)

2-    Explain the role of each personality dimension in dealing with others Its role in dealing

The Personality of the Imam and Its Dimensions

The personality of the Imam and its dimensions has an important role in the impact on the mosque
community and dealing with them. As good manners are required from every Muslim, whether he is a
leader in benefiting the people, or he is one of the majority of the Muslims. Let alone the imam of
the mosque, the orator who holds it upon himself to call and reform people and influence them.
Because the eyes to him are faster, and the mistake from him is more severe. And his message must
be seen in his actions and manners before it is seen or heard in his speech. Therefore, for him to
have good manners is more important and necessary. And that is because of what Allah has placed on
him of the great burdens and responsibilities. As the thinker and writer Essam al-Attar said in a
poem entitled "My travel has prolonged"(1) Thanks for your grace in putting burdens on our
shoulders............ from which you entrusted us with all its troubles

And to protect the imam from people's criticism, let him remind himself with these following
important points, so he can know the need to take care of his character and the art and techniques
in dealing with people; 1-     Winning people's hearts and their love for their imam is one of the
shortest ways to influence them with what he teaches, and encourage them to do good, and to do
charitable projects or useful programs. And it is enough to mention what Allah told his Prophet
(PBUH), and he is someone that is supported by revelation: "So by mercy from Allah, [O Muhammad],
you were lenient with them. And if you had been rude [in speech] and harsh in heart, they would
have disbanded from about you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the
matter. And when you have decided, then rely upon Allah. Indeed, Allah loves those who rely [upon
Him]."(2) Hence, it was one of the major warnings that the prophet warned the imams of the mosques
is not to push people away. As it was narrated by Abu Mas`ud (RA): A man came and said, "O Allah's
Messenger (PBUH)! I keep away from the morning prayer because so-and-so (Imam) prolongs it too
much." Allah's Messenger (PBUH) became furious and I had never seen him more furious than he was on
that day. The Prophet (PBUH) said, "O people! Some of you make others dislike the prayer, so
whoever becomes an Imam he should shorten the prayer, as behind him are the weak, the old and the
needy.''(3) And it was narrated by Jabir bin `Abdullah (RA): Mu`adh bin Jabal used to pray with the
Prophet (PBUH) and then go to lead his people in prayer. Once he led the people in prayer and
recited Surat-al-Baqarah. A man left (the row of the praying people) and offered (light) prayer
(separately) and went away. When Mu`adh came to know about it, he said. "He (that man) is a
hypocrite." Later that man heard what Mu`adh said about him, so he came to the Prophet and said, "O
Allah's Messenger (PBUH)! We are people who work with our own hands and irrigate (our farms) with
our camels. Last night Mu`adh led us in the (night) prayer and he recited Surah-al-Baqara, so I
offered my prayer separately, and because of that, he accused me of being a hypocrite." The Prophet
called Mu`adh and said thrice, "O Mu`adh! Are you putting the people into trials? Recite
'Washshamsi waduhaha' (Quran, 91) or 'Sabbih isma Rabbi ka-l-A'la' (Quran, 87) or the like."(4)



2-    The imam should know that in winning the hearts of his community, he resists and defeats the
strenuous efforts of the enemies of Islam, regardless of their different sects and groups, which
they are spending to distort the image of the truth's advocates by spreading false rumors and
fabrications through various media channels... Thus, the way the imam deals with people should be
the way of a compassionate brother, and a merciful father who takes care of them as well as he
cares for himself. And loves for them what he loves for himself. And closes the doors against the
people of falsehood, so that they cannot harm him or raise suspicions against him.



3-    When the imams of mosques win the hearts of the people around them, they increase the good
ties between the members of the Muslim community. And that would make them compassionate and
merciful individuals. And this is an Islamic goal in itself. As it was narrated by an-Nu'man ibn
Bashir (RA): the messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: "The believers in their mutual kindness,
compassion and sympathy are just like one body. When one of the limbs suffers, the whole body
responds to it with wakefulness and fever."(1)

All those points and others shall give the Imam more emphasis on the need to take care of the arts
of good dealing with people. And the means of gaining their hearts and influence them. All his
matters are enlightened by the prophetic guidance, which reached the highest human example in this
great subject of human morality. And from his biography (PBUH) and guidance we take several
foundations and principles that would form the main pillar on which we build our ways and styles in
dealing with people in general, and especially with the mosque community, as well as the
neighborhood.

Personality Dimensions(2)

The Greeks divided the personality into four elements, namely the optimistic, the angry, the
careless and the pessimistic. And this way of division was adopted by the psychologist Hans Eysenck
in the writing of personality dimensions, in which he divided the personality into two great
dimensions, namely introverted and extroverted. And then created the third dimension, which is the
neurotic, which is called psychological instability and rebellion against customs, laws and
society. And among the characteristics of these dimensions are the following;

Characteristics of the Introverts: â¢    More prone to fluctuating psychological conditions â¢    His
internal condition is edgy â¢    Not socially interactive with others â¢    More sensitive to
experiences â¢    His responses to incidents are deeper and sadder â¢    More conservative, serious
and pessimistic

Characteristics of the Extroverts:

â¢    Less prone to fluctuating psychological conditions â¢    More connected with other people â¢
Indifferent to others and events â¢    Optimistic and energetic

Characteristics of the Neurotics:

â¢    An indication of our readiness to be disturbed, anxious, distressed, panicked or pressured
â¢    More likely to develop mental illness â¢    Very exaggerated in his reactions â¢    Prone to
panic attacks and anxiety

Training Session Takeaways When the imam recognizes the mosque community, he can move to the next
stages of dealing with them according to the various skills and techniques in dealing with them.
And by doing so, you deduce the importance of dealing well with the mosque community and its impact
on changing their behavior for the better, and the development of their religious accountability,
and improving their motivation to visit the mosque. And this step requires the (wise) imam to know
the principles of dealing with the mosque community and be aware of his personality's dimensions
and components. And its impact on the way he deals with the mosque
community.

Creating Impressions and Feelings about Others

When we deal with others in all fields, we get an impression about them, and a picture of them gets
drawn in our minds. And we build on these impressions justifications for their actions and
behaviors that they practice and the way they deal with people. And that would generate an internal
prediction of what behaviours they might do in the future. And these impressions might be correct
and might simply be wrong. And we cannot verify them, but they are mostly affected by many factors
such as tendencies, desires, values, ideas, biases and prejudgments. And those are also affected by
our judgments on others.

It is well established that a combination of factors plays a major role in shaping our impressions
of others and can be summed up by the following;

â¢    Their personality and characteristics â¢    Their behavior in certain situations â¢    Their
social affiliation as a group â¢    Prejudgmentsagainst them â¢    Preliminary information about them
â¢    The way we picture ourselves. It is either we generalize this picture on others, or we see
them inferior to us.

So, mostly the way we make our impressions and feelings about others and its vulnerability to the
influence of many factors leads us to believe that it is expected to be wrong. So, it is wise of
the imam to be careful and patient before judging his impressions and feelings and to allow himself
for more experiences and information before judging others.(1)

Why do we need to know our personalities and the personality of others?

The imam's knowledge of his personality and the personalities of other people from his mosque
community helps to achieve many goals, among them are the following:

1-    Understanding himself and knowing who he is in a better way 2-    Knowing the incentives
towards achievement and innovation 3-    Knowing strengths and weaknesses in personality 4-
Accept the difference with and from others where there are many different personalities in people
5-    Improving communication with himself and others 6-    Knowing his goals and how to achieve
them in accordance with his personality type and other people's 7-    Gives you an idea of what he
can do with his natural ability in the future and excel in it 8-    Understanding and developing
oneself, abilities and skills 9-    Increasing the speed of teaching and learning according to his
personality â

How do you recognize it    Component     Values     Perception     Attitudes



Values, perception, attitudes and their impact on behavior and dealing with others

First: Values

There is no doubt that human values and beliefs affect his behavior and his judgments on things and
individuals, and his dealings with them. And these values differ in the degree of which they are
represented, applied and believed, in one hand. And on the other hand, the way individuals are
overfilled by them and practice them in reality as a natural behavior. Each individual is noticed
to have a value that stands out, and he is known by it. And values are divided into social,
economic, aesthetic and theoretical. In which they, themselves differ based on the extent to which
it is represented by the individual, and reflected in his interests in dealing with others.

The values also influence the rules that the individual sets for himself to regulate his conduct.
And to determine the things he is allowed to do from the things he is not. And it does so by
creating a sense of self-discipline and accountability towards them. And we can categorize those
rules as follows; 1-    General rules and protocols 2-    Social norms and traditions 3-
Civilized laws and rules 4-    Haraam and forbidden legal prohibitions

Second: Perception Perception is a mental process that demonstrates the extent of awareness, human
understanding and knowing the goals of work, people, things and policies surrounding him in the
work environment.

The process of perception goes through many stages where the senses receive information and then
transfer it to the brain, which in turn analyzes it and converts it into responses according to the
understanding formed about this information. And the process of perception is affected by many
factors, such as the ability of the senses (touch, sight, hearing, smell and taste) to receive
information, the psychological, mental and mood state of the individual, the level of education and
previous experiences, the cultural and intellectual level, and the type of environment in which he
lives and the level of his expectations, his feelings, attitudes and needs.



Third: Attitudes Attitudes can be defined as a set of positive or negative ideas that make man tend
to deal with someone, some event, something or some problem in a certain way. And attitudes are
controlled by the personality of the individual and the level of ideas, knowledge, attitude or the
environment surrounding him. Certainly, there is a difference between attitudes and opinions. The
opinion is an expression of an orientation. And attitudes have a great influence on human opinions
and thus reflect on his behavior. And among the most important factors affecting the formation of
human attitudes and is the society in which he lives. And the level in which the individual and
social needs are fulfilled. Also, the experiences and the knowledge he has, as well as the
environmental, natural, social, political, religious and security factors. These factors form a
mixture of attitudes in an individual that are reflected in his behavior and influence his dealing
with others.

Attitudes are generally divided into several parts:

1-    General and private: such as intolerance towards a particular group of individuals like a
tribe, nationality or a sect 2-    Strong and weak: it reflects the strength of reaction on a
particular subject, individual or behaviour. 3-    Secret and public: when you don't express your
attitude towards a subject or person publicly, and you keep your opinion to yourself, it's
described as a secret orientation. And the opposite of this is a public orientation. 4-
Collective and individual: orientation may be collective, such as teaching children a foreign
language. And it could be individually towards a particular person. 5-    Negative and positive: it
is the acceptance, rejection, violation of an individual or a particular idea

The Motives That Drive a Muslim to Deal Well With People

The motives that drive the Muslim to deal well with others go beyond the following:

1-    Complying with the command of Allah, may He be exalted, where he said in the Quran, "Invite
to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is
best. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of
who is [rightly] guided."(1) Allah has ordered us to deal with people with good instruction and to
abide by wisdom in dealing with people. And this is a necessity of which we need to abide by.

2-    Seeking to be among the best of people, as the Muslim seeks to be one of the best of people.
And it was narrated by Abu Huraira (RA), that the Prophet (PBUH) said, "The believer is friendly,
for there is no goodness in one who is neither friendly, nor befriended."(2) And the interest
obtained is for the sake of Allah only and to gain His pleasure.

3-    Dealing with softness and patience, where Allah, may He be exalted commanded His prophet
(PBUH) to deal with softness, where he said: "So by mercy from Allah, [O Muhammad], you were
lenient with them. And if you had been rude [in speech] and harsh in heart, they would have
disbanded from about you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the
matter. And when you have decided, then rely upon Allah . Indeed, Allah loves those who rely [upon
Him]."(3)

4-    Ambition to attain the great reward of good manners, for what Abu Huraira (RA) said: The
Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said "By his good character, a man can reach the degree of the one who
stands in prayer at night."(4)

Your Personality Patterns and Their Impact on Dealing with People

Your dealing with people around you is impacted by your personal and psychological conditions. And
your personality patterns have a profound impact on the way you respond, your conduct and your
behavior, which you should be aware of its importance to recognize its impact on your behavior on
the one hand. And in hand, its importance in correcting the errors that you have and to take care
of others and deal with them with all friendliness and mutual respect that would be reflected on
them by your influence. And humans, in general, are a complex combination of emotions, rationality,
subjectivity, objectivity, internal and external, caution, bravery, forgiveness, rudeness,
generosity, stinginess, transcendence, degradation and other conflicting human tendencies, or the
compatible ones.

The ratio of this behavior or that characteristic increases and decreases generally by the effect
of more complex factors, among them are genetics, education, environmental influences, belief
system, values, social norms, cultural intellectual knowledge, experiences, economic circumstances,
security situation of the person and other factors that are beyond counting. And it is well known
to you, many studies and researches related to the personality patterns, and the attempts to
identify human natures by knowing some of its external-body features (physiognomy) or some of its
psychological and social traits in order to facilitate the process of communicating with the person
through the knowledge of his personality and what might influence him. And the fact is, this
science is not something new, human personality has been studied and examined for many centuries
and many classifications have been written and many psychological and behavioral schools of thought
were established, which led to a multiplicity of views towards man and how he behaves. Therefore,
many classifications and many names have been created. But as a matter of fact, they all agree in
most of their contents, even if their classifications or labels differ.

The method of dealing with personality conditions varies according to the personality condition
patterns that humans go through. And specialists classify that humans communicate by three
psychological conditions called personality conditions. And these conditions consist of a set of
attitudes, values, feelings, ideas and behaviors, and they are as follows:

1-    The parental pattern: this individual is characterized by this pattern as a result of being
influenced by individuals characterized by this pattern. And there are two types of parental
patterns, namely the shepherd, which helps, advises, supports and sympathizes. And the criticizer
pattern, which is characterized by threatening, commanding, prohibiting, scolding and punishing.
And there is no doubt that the individual deals with others as a result of being affected by this
pattern unconsciously. And sometimes, someone needs to use this pattern in a way aimed at changing
a negative behavior that he sees the need to change. And the following figure shows the association
of the parental pattern with others. â

Me                Other people

Parental Pattern (P)



Adult Pattern (A)



Childish Pattern (C)



2-    The adult pattern: this individual is characterized by adult thinking with realism, equality
and objectivity. He is characterized by thinking based on awareness and comprehension of
relationships, possibilities, information, guides and accuracy in analysis, estimation and choice
based on previous experiences before acting appropriately with the situation. And the person
characterized by adultity exchanges information and take appropriate measures to achieve the goal
clearly. And he is calm in solving problems and careful in making judgments. And the following
figure shows the association of the adult pattern with others



Me                Other people

















It should be noted that the individual with an adult pattern chooses the appropriate behavior from
the parental pattern and uses it as well on the childish pattern. So, he understands the importance
of choosing patterns appropriate for the conditions of the individuals.

3-    The childish pattern: which is the pattern in which the person behaves based on the way he
thinks or feels from his feelings, desires, whims, emotions or reactions. And this individual takes
in his dealing with the childish pattern four patterns, namely:

â¢    Adaptive pattern: which achieves the integration of an individual in the various social
circles with which he deals â¢    Submissive pattern: which is characterized by obedience and
submission to others in their opinions and attitudes â¢    Spontaneous pattern: which is known to be
acting spontaneously and expressing his opinions and feelings freely â¢    Rebellious pattern: that
deals aggressively and selfishly with people and seeks to settle scores with themâ

And the following figure shows the association of the childish pattern with
others

solver and that your opinion does not hold any value to him.    He thinks his place in the group

him.



Training Session Takeaways

The wise and kind-hearted imam, with perseverance and patience, along with the skills and
techniques, some of which have already been mentioned above, can accommodate these people in his
community with their different personality types by treating each person with what suits him. And
to approach him from where he can easily influence him. And even raise his status and rectify him
from negativity that may be associated with the personality pattern to which he belongs.

This is an important point which many of those who talk about personality types make the trainee,
the reader or the listener feel that they act as narrow boxes. And that if he knew his type, then
he is stuck with those characteristics that are prominent in the people falls under this particular
type. And perhaps some of them were convinced of his condition and said this is typical although it
is supposed to be that the individual is required to have good character and morals regardless of
his type. Thus, knowledge of these types and patterns should achieve two main goals:

First: Make dealing with others easy by knowing their traits, their conduct and behavior. And to
know the keys in which we can influence their personalities

Second (and more important): Helping people develop themselves, acquire good qualities and overcome
bad ones.

How to Deal With the Mistakes of the Mosque Community

One of the most important skills of dealing with others is to identify ways to prevent problems
before they occur. And to take care of them and to rectify them if they occur. That is because of
the importance of the imam being the social and moral advisor and leader in the mosque and
neighborhood. And here are some of the tips for rectifying the mistakes made by the mosque
community: â¢    Try to address the mistakes indirectly and tactfully: as we have in the Messenger
of Allah (PBUH) a good example when he said to Abdullah bin Omar (RA), "What an excellent man
Abdullah is, if he only observes the night prayer."(1) So, Abdullah used not to sleep at night but
very little henceforward. Criticism and advice are meant to reform others while ensuring that there
is no hatred entered his heart, which is why the adviser should have resorted to hinting at what he
sees as incomplete, but from a hidden side.

â¢    One good way to do that is that you can start with your mistake before the one you speak to.

â¢    Another good way to do it, is to move away from the direct advice or guidance and make it in
the form of gentle suggestions. Try not to use the phrase "Do this and do not do that", and replace
it with "Don't you think it would've been better if we did so and so?" because it is a difficult
thing for the self to accept commands. And even if it was accepted by him, it will still have an
effect on himself. But if it was done in a form of a polite suggestion, then it is more likable and
acceptable to people.

There are still many things to say on the matter, as it is related to self-awareness and the
knowledge of the conditions of the human soul and its different angles. So, it is a good idea to
increase our knowledge in this as much as we can and let our main reference and guide be from the
greatest biography of the Prophet (PBUH) and his guidance in dealing with creation. And Sheikh
Mohammed al-Munajjid wrote a useful book in this regard entitled "How he (PBUH) treated them."

Sharia-wise Methods of Dealing with People

Dealing with people in society consists of different ideologies and backgrounds, such as Muslims,
Kuffar, educated, illiterate, women, men, old and young, highlights the importance of knowing the
methodologies of dealing with different types of people. And we have in the Quran examples of the
commands of Allah to His Messenger (PBUH) on how to deal with the people. And one of the profound
examples is during the conquest of Makkah.

1-    Justice with the wrongdoer One of those rules is justice for the violator or the wrongdoer,
and not to be unjust with him no matter what, even with the Kuffar. Allah says, "O you who have
believed, be persistently standing firm for Allah, witnesses in justice, and do not let the hatred
of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness."(1) And He also
says, "O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for Allah, even
if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives."(2) And He says, "And when you judge between
people to judge with justice."(3) And He says, "And when you testify, be just, even if [it
concerns] a near relative. And the covenant of Allah fulfill."(4) Hence, we must be just with the
wrongdoer, even if we want to fix him or advise him. We do it with justice.

2-    Taking into account the bringing of interests and pushing away the harm It must be taken into
account the bringing of interests and the pushing away the harm, even if it is done by taking the
least harm from two. And the important thing is that the prevention of evil is more prioritized
than bringing interests. And so, the individual should balance his interests when he wants to deal
with others. So, he will follow the appropriate method that achieves the interest and prevent evil.
And this is something that the Prophet (PBUH) has taken in his dealings with others, as evidenced
by many of the incidents and contracts that the Prophet (PBUH) has made with others, even if there
is in these contracts some form of injustice towards the Muslims sometimes.

3-    Knowing the speaker's language and hearing his opinion It is also a rule that should be taken
into account, is to know the language of the speaker and his true opinion. So that he will not be
dealt with unjustly, or his words will not be understood incorrectly. Because understanding the
intent is very important. And there may have been many calamities because of a lack of
understanding of what is meant or because of an incomprehensible word, wars and evil could happen
because of a single word. It is necessary to know the language of the speaker and know the intended
meaning of his words. And if his words bear more than one way of understanding, then we would take
the best meaning of those possible meanings.

4-    The necessity to verify statements Allah says in the Quran, "O you who have believed, if
there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate, lest you harm a people out of
ignorance and become, over what you have done, regretful."(5) Hence, the Muslim must verify the
news he receives. And never hasten in believing rumors or spreading them among the people.
Especially if spreading them could cause dangerous tribulations which could lead to great harm and
evil.



5-    Clearing the mind and heart from the influence of followers Also, among the important issues
in dealing with people is the elimination of the authority of followers. Often the evils in
dealings are caused by the power of some followers on those whom they follow. And they may pass on
to him false news or portray for him the picture in a way that provokes him and make him react to
the situation. And they would exaggerate the issue in a way that may lead them to be in serious
issues. Thus, this leader must verify the news before making any judgement. And when Sheikh Abdul
Aziz bin Abdullah al-Sheikh, the grand mufti of Saudi Arabia, was asked about what is meant by the
rule of eliminating the authority and power of the followers, he answered: "Some people may be
affected by some of his followers, they make him pass judgements towards the other, and they show
him the matter in contrary with what it really is. And that would cause him to hasten in passing
judgement on others unjustly. So, some of those leaders and sheikhs have followers with weak minds
and perceptions that might cause them to give a false image of the reality of what happened. And in
a way that might trigger the anger of those leaders and so on."(1)

Therefore, the imam must get rid of this authority and distance himself from those who try to
impose this authority on him. And he should respond to this follower with wisdom and good advice.
And advise him not to return to that.

A man came to Imam Shafi'i and said to him, "A man is mentioning you in a bad way." And imam
Shafi'i responded, "If you happen to be saying the truth, then you are Nammam (causing hatred
between people), and if you happen to be telling a lie, then you are a sinner." So, the man was
embarrassed and immediately gone.

Saleh Abdel Kaddous said in his poem entitled "Who tells you of an insult by a brother"(2)

Who tells you of an insult by a brother.......... He's the one who insults you. That's something he
didn't face you with.......... The one who told you is to blame

It was said that a man came to Wahab ibn Manabeh and said: "Someone had insulted you" So, Wahab
said, "And the Shaitan did not find other messengers than yourself?"

A wise man once was told, "someone talked bad about you while you're gone". And he responded: "If
he beats me while I'm gone, I wouldn't care about him either."(3)

Effective Dealing Skills with the Mosque Community

The skills of influencing others are one of the most important skills related to human
communication. And the most needed people are the influencers who seek to make radical changes in
others. Especially if these changes are correctional and reformative. And if someone contemplates
on the process of influence, he would realize that it depends on addressing intellect as well as
emotions. And the more the methodology is mind-provoking and addressing the emotions, the more it
will bring influence and success. And you will find this approach clearly practiced in the
prophetic education derived from the Quran and Sunnah. And some of these skills will be shown
below.

1-    Effective communication Communication is defined as a social process between two parties to
transmit, send and receive information in the form of a written or verbal message, whether written,
audio or visually, by the (Sender) first party, to the (Receiver) second party, and vice versa. In
order to get the receiver's response about it through the formation of a common
understanding.





The communication between the sender and the receiver is made through a channel that carries a
message. And this message is answered by the receiver to the sender, and is expected to be using
the same channel or maybe another channel.

The components of the communication process:

1-    Sending information: Whereas the sender conveys information to the receiver through several
ways such as body language like smiling, or an action like hugging, or by language like in writing
or voice or image, just like pictures displayed in meetings to explain data or problem statements.
And this language has an important role in the interpretation of the message. The language shared
between individuals has an important role in the delivery of the message and its ease and clarity
of understanding. And this is achievable through the use of concepts, terms and words expressive
and indicative of the subject and not carrying more than one meaning or containing
incomprehensible, vague or foreign phrases that the other party cannot read or understand its
meaning.

2-    Receiving information: If the message was received and the sender succeeded in sending it,
that does not mean the communication was a successful communication. As the receiver or the second
party is yet to process this message and understand its meanings. This is done by listening or
paying attention or interpretation of the meanings and concepts of the message and to form a true
picture of it and its content so he can give the next process of communication, which is the
feedback returned to the sender at the right time, in order to help in completion of the
communication process successfully.

Stages of the communication process

1-    The existence of the motive, desire and ability of the sender 2-    Determining the wording
of the message o    What Do I want from the message? o    When do I want it? o    Where do I want
that? o    How to achieve that? o    Why would I want that? "What benefit will it do to me?" 3-
Accomplishing and implementing the message on the ground 4-    Receiving the message 5-
Listening attentively 6-    Receiver's feedback to the message o    Positive o    Negative







Barriers to Effective Communication

Sender-oriented Communication Barriers â¢    The purpose of the message is not clear â¢
Communicate the message in a vague and incomprehensible way â¢    Delivering the message at the
wrong time â¢    Failure to use effects and other means to illustrate the idea â¢    Weaknesses in
the sender (e.g. shyness, low voice, ...etc)

Receiver-oriented Communication Barriers â¢    Doesn't listen well or pay attention to the message
â¢    Misinterpretation and lack of proper understanding of the message due to different cultures,
beliefs and values â¢    Keeps on interrupting and responding before the entire message is delivered
completely

External Communication Barriers â¢    Noise      â¢    Lack of clarity of the message â¢    Lack of
clarity of the translation (if any)

2-    Meaningful dialogue and persuasion The dialogue method based on the combination of mental
persuasion and balanced emotional touching, is known to be among the most effective methods of
influencing and getting the desired outcome of communication. It is not a bunch of abstract ideas
that satisfy the mind, nor is it solely focused on emotional influence that if its effect faded
away or reduced then the communication is lost or interrupted. And you will find this methodology
clearly in the Quran and the practice of the prophet (PBUH) in giving Dawah to people of different
kinds and influence them. And you will notice that dialogue is from the most common ways of
communication mentioned in the Quran, while addressing the greatest and most important matters,
"Tawheed", and proving the existence of the Creator and His worthiness of worship, and his ability
to resurrect and bring the dead back to life. Although it is one of the clearest ideas naturally
and intuitively, yet you find the Qur'anic method of persuasion adopts dialogue based on addressing
the mind and provoking emotions to clear this idea even more, and to establish the truth in a way
no one can deny. Read and contemplate on the matter of the one who denounced the possibility of
resurrecting the bodies and bones after they were worn out and became dust. Allah says, "And he
presents for Us an example and forgets his [own] creation. He says, "Who will give life to bones
while they are disintegrated?" Say, "He will give them life who produced them the first time, and
He is, of all creation, Knowing."(1) And He also says to those who are astonished or deny that
Jesus was born without a father: "Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He
created Him from dust; then He said to him, "Be," and he was."(2) The Ayah is basically saying, "O'
you who denies the miraculous birth of Jesus without a father, why did you not deny the creation of
Adam who did not have a father nor he had a mother, which is far more miraculous and yet you accept
that it did happen by the power of Allah.





You will note that this type of dialogue based on these two principles was practiced by the Prophet
(PBUH) in his influence on the people and their different mental and intellectual levels. It was
narrated by Imran bin Husain (RA), that he said, "The Prophet (PBUH) said to my father: 'O Husain,
how many deities do you worship now?' He said: 'Seven. Six in the earth, and one above the
heavens.' He said: 'So which of them do you take for your ardent requests and fears?' He said: 'The
one above the heavens.' He said: 'O Husain, if you would but accept Islam, I would teach you two
phrases that would benefit you.'" He said: "So when Husain accepted Islam, he said: 'O Messenger of
Allah, teach me the two phrases you promised me.' So he (PBUH) said: "Say: O Allah, inspire me with
my guidance, and protect me from the evil of my soul."(1) You see how dialogue is so effective that
Imran's father accepted Islam as a result of that dialogue with the Prophet (PBUH). In another
incident of influence and persuasion used by the prophet (PBUH), his dialogue with that young man
who came to ask permission in adultery. Narrated by Abu Umaamah (RA) that he said: "A young man
came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, "O Messenger of Allaah,
give me permission to commit Zina." The people turned to him to rebuke him, saying, "Shh, shh."
(The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) said, "Come here." So he came close to
him, and he told him to sit down. He said, "Would you like that for your mother?" He said, "No, by
Allaah, may I be sacrificed for you." He said, "Nor do people like it for their mothers." He said,
"Would you like it for your daughter?" He said, "No, by Allaah, may I be sacrificed for you." He
said, "Nor do people like it for their daughters." He said, "Would you like it for your sister?" He
said, "No, by Allaah, may I be sacrificed for you." He said, "Nor do people like it for their
sisters." He said, "Would you like it for your paternal aunt?" He said, "No, by Allaah, may I be
sacrificed for you." He said, "Nor do people like it for their paternal aunts." He said, "Would you
like it for your maternal aunt?" He said, "No, by Allaah, may I be sacrificed for you." He said,
"Nor do people like it for their maternal aunts." Then he placed his hand on him and said, "O
Allaah, forgive his sin, purify his heart, and guard his chastity." And after that, this young man
never did anything."(2)

And in so many incidents we can witness the prophet (PBUH) and his companions (RA) utilizing this
technique of persuasion using dialogues and conversations. It is one of the strongest methods of
influence and positive change in people. It makes the receiver think, clarify ideas and gives him
the freedom to discuss any idea that is presented to him until he finds in them a solution that is
consistent with common sense and solid reason without it being imposed on him by force or making
him follow blindly.



3-    Good advice It is a very influential method to the receiver, whether he is young or old. It
involves focusing on emotions by including mental meanings, ideas, principles and theoretical
ideals in living examples that make their impact on the soul deeper and their presence in reality
clearer because of it addressing the self and touching its emotions. The effective advice opens its
way to the soul directly through conscience, like the rain when it descends on the dry thirsty
earth and waters it. And its effect remained temporally and needed to be repeated as much as
needed. Therefore, this method of advice and storytelling was among the prophetic methods in
conveying the message, educate and influence the people, but it was done with the appropriate
extent to achieve the desired effect without having any side effects. The narration of Ibn Masood
(RA) made this clear when he said: "The Prophet (PBUH) used to take care of us in preaching by
selecting a suitable time, so that we might not get bored."(1)

4-    Presenting examples and storytelling The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) did not leave his
instructions and advice empty of giving examples and include them with stories to make the impact
of the advice stronger and firmer. And the examples of this are so many. The importance of using
the examples in education is due to the fact that it has great power in showing the intended
meaning accurately. And to simplify words with giving a precise yet brief explanation of the
purpose for which speech was given. And it is the greatest method of influence because it provokes
emotions and feelings, which in turn would prompt the human to adhere to the principles
practically. And besides that, it helps to visualize the meanings and embody them in mind. And
through that, it facilitates understanding and install the meanings in memory, and retrieve them
when needed.

The same thing applies to storytelling, in achieving convince and influence. That is because people
are attracted by nature to stories, and if you deposit wisdom and lessons in the stories, then the
purpose may be attained. And the examples of this in the Sunnah are many. There are many famous
stories that you get amazed when looking at their educational connotations that have a great impact
on achieving the effect of many principles, ideals and correct ideas. Stories like the people of
the cave, the story of the bold, the leper, and the blind and other stories. As the Prophet (PBUH)
was not to tell stories just for the sake of entertainment, but he used to tell stories to
immortalize in their contents principles, convictions, ideals and ideas that are at the heart of
religion, truth and proper education. And when presented in this interesting storytelling method,
they were more influential and had a deeper impact on education. And became a rich source for
learning and simulation in style and content.



5-    Respect Respect is defined as a feeling that shows deep admiration for someone elicited by
his age, status, superiority or merit.(1) And Allah paired respect with worship when he spoke about
parents' rights as an example. And He joined it with worshipping Him, when He said in the Quran
"And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him, and to parents, good treatment. Whether
one or both of them reach old age [while] with you, say not to them [so much as], "uff," and do not
repel them but speak to them a noble word. And lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and
say, "My Lord, have mercy upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small.""(2)     By
definition, respect in dealing with others is the most important skill to have. And it is based on
justice, equality, honesty and responsibility. And it is the imam's responsibility to take
responsibility for the team and to win their respect. And among the many forms of respect: â¢
Respect Allah, may He be exalted, in worshipping Him and following his orders and avoiding his
prohibitions â¢    Respect people and their rights â¢    Respect parents as mentioned above â¢
Respect women â¢    Respect the elderly â¢    Respect the people with special needs â¢    Respect the
opinions and not to mock them â¢    Respect and care for animals and plants â¢    Respect oneself
There are many forms of respect, however, it is generally an integral part of the respectful
person, with which he lives and behaves. The true respectful person is internally aware of the
origin of respect and makes sure that it is always maintained while the person who just shows off
respect without internal roots within himself will show the opposite in the nearest situation that
exposes his real personality. 6-    The Good Role-model It is one of the greatest and most
influential methods ever. And the fact of the matter is that this method is clearer than to make it
clear. That is the people are naturally influenced by living examples and practical behaviors, far
more than abstract words, even if the words are convincing. And one of the clearest examples that
shows this, is the incident happened with the Prophet (PBUH) and his companions in the treaty of
Hudaybiyyah: When the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) concluded the writing of the peace treaty, Allah's
Messenger (PBUH) said to his companions, "Get up and' slaughter your sacrifices and get your head
shaved." By Allah none of them got up, and the Prophet repeated his order thrice. When none of them
got up, he left them and went to Um Salama and told her of the people's attitudes towards him. Um
Salama said, "O the Prophet (PBUH) of Allah! Do you want your order to be carried out? Go out and
don't say a word to anybody till you have slaughtered your sacrifice and call your barber to shave
your head." So, the Prophet (PBUH) went out and did not talk to any one of them till he did that,
i.e. slaughtered the sacrifice and called his barber who shaved his head. Seeing that, the
companions of the Prophet (PBUH) got up, slaughtered their sacrifices, and started shaving the
heads of one another, and there was so much rush that there was a danger of killing each other.(1)

If you reflect on the prophet biography (Seerah), you will find this method utilized in a lot of
educational incidents and practices. And this is because of its great impact on the formation and
consolidation of conviction. In addition to the strength of its impact and the speed in achieving
the intended outcome. One of those examples was in the narration of Malik ibn Al-Huwayreth (RA)
when he said, "We came to the Prophet (PBUH) and we were (a few) young men of approximately equal
age and stayed with him for twenty nights. Then he thought that we were anxious for our families,
and he asked us whom we had left behind to look after our families, and we told him. He was
kindhearted and merciful, so he said, "Return to your families and teach them (religious knowledge)
and order them (to do good deeds) and offer your prayers in the way you saw me offering my prayers,
and when the stated time for the prayer becomes due, then one of you should pronounce its call
(i.e. the Adhan), and the eldest of you should lead you in prayer."(2) Another narration by Jabir
ibn Abdullah (RA) is saying, "I saw the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) stone the Jamrat while on his
camel saying: "O people, learn your rituals (of Hajj) for I do not know whether I will perform Hajj
again after this year.'"(3) And if we want to mention all of the incidents and narrations, where
the prophet of Allah (PBUH) was an example and role model to his companions then it will take us a
very long time to do so.

Aisha (RA) summed it up in the best summary could be, and explained it in the shortest manner,
where Yazid ibn Babnos (RA) narrates by saying, "We went to 'A'isha (RA) and said, 'Umm
al-Mu'minin, what was the character of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) like?' She replied, 'His
character was the Qur'an. Can you recite the sura entitled "The Believers"?' She said, 'Recite: "It
is the believers who are successful: those who are humble in their prayer; those who turn away from
the worthless talk; those who actively pay zakat; those who guard their private parts." (23:1-5)'
She said, 'That was the character of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace.'"(4)

This shows that the noble ideals and great values are always in need of being applied and
practiced. And without that they remain a dead letter that will not come into reality unless they
turn into practical behavior on which individuals will follow in their actions, feelings and ideas.
And this places a great responsibility on the Imam of the mosque in being one of the pillars of
society in the process of influence and reformation through the correct behavior and good dealing
sought in accordance with the principles he calls for. As Allah, may He be exalted said "O you who
have believed, why do you say what you do not do? Great is hatred in the sight of Allah that you
say what you do not do."(5)

7-    Thanks and praise Narrated by Abu Hurairah (RA): "The Prophet (ï·º) said: He who does not thank
the people is not thankful to Allah."(6) Hence, thanks and praise increases the love, friendliness
and respect between the people who thank each other. â

Techniques of Influencing the Mosque Community

To win the hearts of the mosque community, make them want to come back to the mosque frequently,
and perform the prayers in congregation regularly, is a great thing to achieve as an Imam. It is
the responsibility of the imam, who, if he has the sincere intention and passion, to win their
hearts, influence them, and not to drive them away from the mosque by prolonging the prayers for an
example. And he should diversify his methods and styles of dealing with them. This is one of the
pillars of the imam's influence on the community and their adherence to his directions and their
acceptance of what he says and wants. That is because the people trust the competent imam with a
good reputation, good conduct and behavior, which is based on the guidance of the Prophet (PBUH)
and his qualities, actions, practices and behaviors. And he has what he had of patience,
compassion, forgiveness, calmness, generosity, charity, honesty and other good manners. And among
the techniques that affect the community of the mosque are the following:

1-    Utilizing body language The verbal word alone does not fulfill its desired role until it is
accompanied by good body language. And this language may be more accurate and true in speech than
speech itself. That is because speech can be contrary to reality, but the expression of the face
and the language of the eyes may not be the same and they are difficult to fake. And body language
could be expressed through the eyes, the arms, facial expressions, movement of the hands, feet or
head. And even through the dress. And here are some details below, related to the skill of body
language:

First: Facial expression Just as man can express with his eyes what he wants and can explore what
is in the hearts of others by contemplating on the looks of their eyes, he can also do so by
contemplating on facial expressions, whether it's from skin color, lips, cheeks or forehead. Think
about what Allah said: "And when one of them is informed of [the birth of] a female, his face
becomes dark, and he suppresses grief."(1) And He said: "And when Our verses are recited to them as
clear evidences, you recognize in the faces of those who disbelieve disapproval. They are almost on
the verge of assaulting those who recite to them Our verses. Say, "Then shall I inform you of [what
is] worse than that? [It is] the Fire which Allah has promised those who disbelieve, and wretched
is the destination.""(2) And said: "But they who have earned [blame for] evil doings - the
recompense of an evil deed is its equivalent, and humiliation will cover them. They will have from
Allah no protector. It will be as if their faces are covered with pieces of the night - so dark
[are they]. Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally."(3) And many
other verses.

Frowning builds barriers between you and others, so you have to learn how to control your thoughts
and feelings so your frown can then be intentional, controlled and sends a specific message at the
right time.



And the most common manifestation of frowning is a scowling forehead, straightening the cheeks,
showing teeth, squeezed dry lips and a dark face.

And these are some hints that have an impact on the successful message delivery through facial
expressions:

1-    Make the smile as your key and messenger to the hearts of others. And it also brings comfort
and tranquility to the one who is smiling. It was narrated by Abu Dhar (RA) that he said: The
Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: "Your smiling in the face of your brother is charity, commanding
good and forbidding evil is charity, your giving directions to a man lost in the land is charity
for you. Your seeing for a man with bad sight is a charity for you, your removal of a rock, a thorn
or a bone from the road is charity for you. Your pouring what remains from your bucket into the
bucket of your brother is charity for you."(1) 2-    When you feel that people started to ignore
your speech and the reception of your message is disrupted, stir things up with a joke followed by
a smile. 3-    Beware of a sarcastic or cold smile that prevents others from trusting you 4-    Try
to get used to making your smile as a way to communicate your message as intended, even if your
feelings are not as happy.

And as the face expresses what is in the heart, the movements of the hands and feet and movements
of the shoulders and how to sit or walk expresses what is in the heart as well. And they give an
accurate report about your mental state, as well as the state of the receiver. Thus, make sure that
you unerstand the body language so you can respond to it well.

Second: Eye language Allah, may He be exalted said: "Indisposed toward you. And when fear comes,
you see them looking at you, their eyes revolving like one being overcome by death. But when fear
departs, they lash you with sharp tongues, indisposed toward [any] good. Those have not believed,
so Allah has rendered their "deeds worthless, and ever is that, for Allah, easy."(2)
The poet Sarra Durrun said: (3) The looks of the eyes would show.......... what is in the hearts of
hatred resentment
And the poet Hais Bais said: (4) The eye shows what is in the heart of its owner.......... whether
it was hatred or love The obnoxious has an eye that exposes........... what is in his heart and he
cannot hide it The eye speaks and the mouths are silent........... So you can see from the bottom
of the heart a clear statement
Yes, the eyes are not only a mean to see the outside, but an eloquent mean to express what is
inside us to the world. â
There are anxious and troubled looks, and other defeated and submissive looks. Rebellious, hateful
and sarcastic ones. Determined, indifferent, puzzled or loving ones, and so on. There are many
different ways of eye expressions and the Quran called certain eyes as deceiving eyes when He, may
He be exalted said: "He knows that which deceives the eyes and what the breasts conceal."(1) And
the human being should use his eyes to understand others' eyes expressions, as well as to express
his own.
The successful eye messages: If you want to deliver your message with your eyes, make sure you do
the following: 1-    Your eyes should be relaxed while speaking, making the other feel confident
and comfortable with you and the validity of your thoughts. 2-    Talk to him with your head high
because lowering your head during the talk gives the impression of defeat and weakness. 3-    Do
not look far away from the speaker or looking at the sky or the ground while talking because it
gives the impression of indifference to who you are talking to or not paying attention to the
subject in which you are talking 4-    Don't stare too long at the one you're talking to, as it may
make them feel embarrassed or tensed. 5-    Beware of too much blinking while talking because it
gives the impression of instability and worrisome. 6-    Stay away from wearing dark sunglasses
while talking to others because it hinders the building of trust between you and them 7-    Beware
of the dull, satirical glances towards whom you are talking to, because it burns the bridges of
understanding and trust between you and him and does not encourage him to continue to communicate
with you.
2-    The nice word:
Speaking is the most common mean of communication and influence. And whenever the imam succeeds in
mastering the art of speaking with eloquence, the more he can influence others and guide them in
the direction he wants. And we know that the miracle of the Quran that caused the Arabs to be
humbled by it, was nothing but the language and the eloquence of the Quran. And the Prophet (PBUH)
has reached the pinnacle of this with his influence reaching the highest levels an influence could
ever do.
Choosing the eloquent words that influence others has the most profound effect in conveying the
meanings to the mosque community. It was narrated by Abdullah ibn Omar (RA) saying, "Two men from
the east stood up and spoke, and people were amazed at their eloquence. The Messenger of Allah
(PBUH), said, 'Some eloquence is magic,' or he said, 'Part of eloquence is magic.' "(1)

And these are some of the directions that if the imam would take, he can largely succeed in
communicating his verbal message.
1-    Being familiar with the terms of the topic in which you are speaking has a great role in your
message being accepted and respected, especially by the professionals or the specialists in the
field. 2-    Determine the amount of speech you want to say, with no damaging brevity, or boring
lengthy details, and then select the right time when you want to talk, as the mischoice of time may
be a reason not to accept your words. And know that each place has its subject, and each condition
may require a different style from other conditions. 3-    The clarity in speech is one of the most
important reasons for the other side to interact with your speech, but when the speech is vague and
unclear, others will not interact with it. 4-    The tone of the voice and its interaction with the
meanings of the words is one of the most important means of conveying the message to the mosque
community. As you may hear the same speech from two different people, but you would interact with
one of them and be affected and excited about him, whereas the other does not move one hair on
you.
A team of researchers carried out studies in Britain in 1970 on the effect of speech on others. And
they found that words and phrases have 7% of the effect. And that the voice tone has 38% of the
effect. And those other body expressions like the eyes, face, hands and body, they have 55% of the
effect, which shows the importance of body language in delivering the message. And we will come
into that later.
And beware of speech errors and flaws, including: 1-    Speaking very quickly in a way that does
not allow the listener to understand the words. And the way the prophet (PBUH) used to speak was
described as if someone wants to count the words, he could have been able to. And that he would
even repeat the word three times for the companions to understand him. 2-    The ambiguity of
speech and the lack of clarity in phrases 3-    Speaking at the same pace, whether the situation
calls for laughter, joy, sadness, crying, enthusiasm or calmness. And this is one of the worst
flaws of speech 4-    Too much usage of metaphors and digressions so that the message is forgotten
and the listener no longer knows in which topic the speaker is. And he even might forget the whole
subject of the speech.
And the word has its significance in Islam and in reality. As it was said in the hadith of Abu
Hurairah (RA) that the Messenger (PBUH) said: "A man may utter a word which pleases Allah without
giving it much importance, and because of that Allah will raise him to degrees (of reward in
Jannah); another one may utter a word (carelessly) which displeases Allah without thinking of its
gravity and because of that he will be thrown into the Hell-Fire. "(2)
The word can even revive the spirit or kill it, by the permission of Allah, and it can also put
someone in high position or remove him from it, by the permission of Allah. The biographers wrote
that a prince saw in his sleep that his teeth were all taken off except one. So, he called people
to interpret this dream for him. And one of them said to him: Your family will all die and then you
will die after them. And the prince ordered him to be disciplined and kicked him out of the palace.
And then called another interpreter, and the interpreter said: You are the longest of your family
in age and the last of your family to die, O' Prince. So, the prince ordered him to be honored and
he admired what he said although it had the same meaning with the previous interpretation. Hence we
get to the fact that choosing the right words has manners, taste and beauty. As it also has a great
role in influencing the receivers and his acceptance of the speech, guidance and advice. And this
is a broad topic, so we will just hint on some of them and you would relate the rest of them by
knowing these examples:
â¢    Call on the mosque community with the most favorite names to their hearts. And make them feel
your respect to them and your friendliness in calling them. And this is a prophetic approach, as it
was narrated by Anas ibn Malik (RA) that he said: "The Prophet (PBUH) used to mix with us to the
extent that he would say to a younger brother of mine, 'O Aba `Umair! What did the Nughair (a kind
of bird) do?""(1) Thus, we find in this hadith two qualities the prophet (PBUH) had; giving the
child a Kunyah (a name that begins with "father of ..."), and his playing with him, asking him
about his bird. â¢    Be sure to memorize their names and know their lineage. And know their
children and then ask them about them from time to time. This has s great impact on winning their
hearts.
â¢    Choose encouraging and loving that would make them desire to do what you call them to. And
that was the prophet's habit (PBUH), as it was narrated by Salamah (RA) saying: "Ali happened to
stay behind the Prophet (PBUH) and (did not join him) during the battle of Khaibar for he was
having eye trouble. Then he said, "How could I remain behind Allah's Messenger (PBUH)?" So `Ali set
out following the Prophet (PBUH), When it was the eve of the day in the morning of which Allah
helped (the Muslims) to conquer it, Allah's Messenger (PBUH) said, "I will give the flag (to a
man), or tomorrow a man whom Allah and His Apostle love will take the flag," or said, "A man who
loves Allah and His Apostle; and Allah will grant victory under his leadership." Suddenly came `Ali
whom we did not expect. The people said, "This is `Ali." Allah's Messenger (PBUH ï·º) gave him the
flag and Allah granted victory under his leadership."(2)
â¢    Thus, if you want to rectify one of the people from a bad behavior or a mistake, you should
avoid as much as possible talking to him from the position of an adviser or preacher, rather look
for something that this person wishes to attain, and then link that goal to the abstaining from
this bad habit and you will find that he is really improving and leaving that habit. And of course,
that does not mean that preaching is always to be avoided. Every situation has its own need. â
â¢    Mastery in speaking is a great blessing in which enables you to win the hearts of people and
bring the goodness and purity out of them. And among the best of what you can use in your words are
those who carry the good news to them and those which are easy on them. And to make that of which
you think they want to listen to first, to attract them and open their hearts to talk to you
comfortably. And you would listen to them eagerly until you feel that the time is right to put
forward what you have. And this is part of the wisdom that Allah spoke about and said "But none is
granted it except those who are patient, and none is granted it except one having a great portion
[of good]."(1)
â¢    This also includes the usage of praise and encouragement, which is part of human nature.
Although the Muslim must be doing things for the sake of Allah's pleasure and does not wait for
thanks from the people, that is instilled in human nature. As it was narrated by Abu Hurairah (RA)
saying: that the Prophet (PBUH) said: "He who does not thank the people is not thankful to
Allah."(2) And it was also narrated by Anas ibn Malik (RA), that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
said: O God, there is no life, but the life of the Hereafter, So forgive Thou the Ansar and the
Muhajirs."(3) And by Ibn Umar (RA): "The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, "Grant shelter to him who
begs for it in the Name of Allah, give to him who begs in the Name of Allah, accept the invitation
of him who invites you, and requite him who does a favour to you, but if you are unable to requite
him, go on praying for him till you are sure that you have requited him adequately.""(4)
â¢    And one of the great examples mentioned in the Sunnah showing how important is the impact of
praise and encouragement has upon people and in supporting the truth, is what was narrated by Ans
ibn Malik (RA) that when (the news of) the advance of Abu Sufyan (at the head of a force) reached
him. The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) held consultations with his Companions. The narrator said: Abu
Bakr spoke (expressing his own views), but he (the Holy Prophet) did not pay heed to him. Then
spoke 'Umar (expressing his views), but he (the Holy Prophet) did not pay heed to him (too). Then
Sa'd b. 'Ubada stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, you want us (to speak). By God in whose
control is my life, if you order us to plunge our horses into the sea, we would do so. If you order
us to goad our horses to the most distant place like Bark al-Ghimad, we will do so. The narrator
said: Now the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) called upon the people (for the encounter). So they set out
and encamped at Badr. (Soon) the water-carriers of the Quraish arrived. Among them was a black
slave belonging to Banu al-Hajjaj. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) caught him and
interrogated him about Abu Sufyan and his companions. He said: I know nothing about Abu Sufyan, but
Abu Jahl, Utba, Shaiba and Umayya b. Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him. Then he
said: All right, I will tell you about Abu Sufyan. They would stop beating him and then ask him
(again) about Abu Sufyan. He would again say', I know nothing about Abu Sufyan, but Abu Jahl.
'Utba, Shaiba and Umayya b. Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him likewise. The
Messenger of Allah (PBUH) was standing in prayer. When he saw this he finished his prayer and said:
By Allah in Whose control is my life, you beat him when he is telling you the truth, and you let
him go when he tells you a lie. The narrator said: Then the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: This is
the place where so and so would be killed. He placed his hand on the earth (saying) here and here;
(and) none of them fell away from the place which the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) had indicated by
placing his hand on the earth.(5) As the narrator has said that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) was
pleased with the words of Sa`d and was encouraged to march on. And there are many other examples of
this sort.
3-    Address their humanity â¢    Islam is keen to establish human relations between the
individuals of the society on a solid basis, namely mercy, love, justice, and kindness following
the teachings of Allah when he said in the Quran "O mankind, indeed We have created you from male
and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the noblest of
you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted."
And therefore, the purpose of creating us in different nations and tribes is to get to know each
other. And to grow relationships and bonds between each other. And to be addressing people as if
they did not have feelings or emotions is considered a kind of violation of them and their rights.
And among the most important thing that affects them is to know how to approach their feelings and
emotions and address their humanity.
Human relations categorize the developmental stages of human relations into the following: (1)
â¢    The Beginning: first meeting between two people and seeing each other for the first time. â¢
The Experience: at this stage, they get to know each other and exchange interests, in politics,
economics, social, art, cultural or sports. â¢    The Reinforcement: at this stage, relationships
are strengthened and reinforced by repeated meetings and exchange of visits and gifts. â¢    The
Complementarity: when interests are alike and supporting each other, they are joined together in
some situations while keeping each person's personality components intact. â¢    The Relationship:
where each side is committed to each other in many things including work, help, and solving
problems
4-    Don't tell them they're wrong, rather guide them
One of the easiest ways to gain hostility with others and push them to shout at you or offend you,
is to tell them that they are wrong. No one wants to hear that he is wrong even if you are trying
to change their thinking or behavior for the better. And among the most things that affect them
negatively and positively is to deal with them in a successful manner. And because our role model
in dealing with the people is the Prophet (PBUH) and the way he dealt with his companions in many
occasions, we see evidence of how important is to utilize this technique in rectifying and guiding
peoples behaviors and their ways of thinking without directly reprimanding them and addressing
them.
The reason for not accepting advice and guidance, is due to the human ego, arrogance and excessive
self-esteem, which leads the person to look at himself narcissistically and above others. And he
considers every mistake he makes as a kind of perfection and does not see himself to be wrong even
if he is aware deep down in himself that he is. And here the question arises of how can we direct
this kind of people and make them aware of what they have done, and change their behavior?
Especially when this is an important role for the Muslim to be doing as to enjoin goodness and
forbid evil. And for that, we have two alternatives that we will propose in the following:
First: Praise and appreciation, and then expressing the point of view. For example: I respect your
ideas and opinions, but I beg to differ... Given my experience in this field, and I do respect
yours, but I have another opinion... From your perspective this is true, but from my perspective, I
have a different opinion...
Second: Do not use "correct" and "not correct" in judging actions. But rather focus on the
following keys in the dialogue: (1) â¢    Experiences and results of real practices of behavior
similar to this â¢    Ideas that are rooted in others about similar behaviors â¢    And the end, talk
about management and its relationship to these practices and their consequences in the light of
these circumstances
5-    The general guidance for influencing people
â¢    People hate advice in public â¢    Don't blame people too often â¢    It's wise to admit that
you made a mistake â¢    Don't be proud of yourself and become arrogant â¢    Highlight the positive
side first, and then mention the negative â¢    People dislike and stay away from those who don't
forget their mistakes â¢    Don't criticize anyone directly â¢    A hint towards the error and with
all courtesy â¢    Talk about your mistakes first and then make polite suggestions to fix the
mistakes of others â¢    Don't tell anyone that he's wrong directly â¢    Don't hurt other people's
feelings â¢    Avoid prolonged argumentation â¢    Show your care about people more than your care
about yourself â¢    Do praise and give thanks, everyone loves it. â¢    Let others think that the
idea came from them â¢    Address the feelings of others and understand their emotions â¢    Gifts
have indescribable charm in affecting people
Training Session Takeaways
In conclusion: It is important for the imam and the orator to take care of the method of
encouraging and warning people. In addition to the method of using sound logical arguments, and the
importance of the knowledge of the etiquettes of dialogue as well as the methods of which speech
can be delivered in an influential and correct manner. As it was narrated by Abdullah ibn Omar (RA)
saying, "Two men from the east stood up and spoke, and people were amazed at their eloquence. The
Messenger of Allah (PBUH), said, 'Some eloquence is magic,' or he said, 'Part of eloquence is
magic.' "(1) And we also know also how important the body language is.
And the Imam must know that the hearts of people are between two Fingers of Allah's Fingers, He
changes them as He wills. And the imam should always humble himself in front of Allah in prayers,
asking for help, success, guidance, and to guide the mosque community and all Muslims towards
goodness, righteousness, piety and guidance. For what Allah said in the Quran: "Indeed, [O
Muhammad], you do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He is most knowing
of the [rightly] guided."(2)
And may Allah send His peace and blessings to our prophet Muhammad (PBUH), to his family and
companions. And all praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds
